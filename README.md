Fantasy Ballsack
================

This app allows you to calculate the optimal lineup for a fantasy ball team.

You provide these inputs:

<ul>
  <li>Budget</li>
  <li>Team size</li>
  <li>List of player values</li>
  <li>List of player prices</li>
</ul>

Fantasy Ballsack will then calculate your optimal lineup using the solutions to the class Knapsack 0-1 problem with mutliple constraints.
